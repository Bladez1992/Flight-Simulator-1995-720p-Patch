# Microsoft Flight Simulator 1995 720p Patch
This is the patch I made for MSFS 1995 so it runs at 720p (1280x720) both in windowed and fullscreen modes - included in my Microsoft Flight Simulator - Classic Collection repack

Step 1: You will need to manually edit the path
C:\Path\To\Game\Install\Directory\
in both LAUNCH.bat and LAUNCH.ps1 to match where Flight Simulator 1995 is installed to

Step 2: Drag all of the files included in this archive into your Flight Simulator 1995 directory from step 1 - overwrite all files when asked

Step 3: Run LAUNCH.bat as an admin to play the game

This archive includes a copy of [QRes by Anders Kjersem](https://qres.sourceforge.net) - it is essential for the powershell script to function
